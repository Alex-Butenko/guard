# Code Snippets

To use the code snippets on Visual Studio, copy the `guard-cs.vs.snippet` file into a folder that is
recognized by the Visual Studio Code Snippets Manager. You can go to `Tools` > `Code Snippets Manager`
(CTRL+K, CTRL+B) in Visual Studio to list these folders or add a new one.

The following folder should be recognized by default (don't forget to replace 2017 with your own
Visual Studio version):
`%userprofile%\Documents\Visual Studio 2017\Code Snippets\Visual C#\My Code Snippets`
